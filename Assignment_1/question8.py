# A) Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two 
# attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called describe_restaurant() 
# that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a 
# message indicating that the restaurant is open. Make an instance called restaurant from your 
# class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods. 
# B) Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, and then 
# create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called 
# describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called 
# greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user. Create several instances representing 
# different users, and call both method for each user.
